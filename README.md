# Reason for the project: 
    This project was built to apply and showcase the skills we have learned during  phase three training of the Software Engineering Live class - Flatiron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). JavaScript and React were to manipulate the DOM, and HTML and CSS were used to develop and design the components. To create a backend API for our application, Sinatra was used to implement CRUD actions, Active Record to perform SQL queries, and Ruby to create classes, endpoints, and http responses.

# Project Description: 
    The Best Friend Business is a management resource for organizations in the business of helping people find their best friends. As a shelter resource, it lets you keep track of all the animals in your system, the adoption applications submitted for every animal, and shelter locationsâ€”all in one convenient place! 

    On the animals page, the organization can view all the animals in their system, including details such as the name, breed, and shelter location of each animal. The organization is also able to add an animal, update/edit the animal, or delete the animal from the database. There is a search feature, where animals can be found using any of their details, and there is a filter to view by only dogs or cats.
    
    Similarly on the applications page and shelter page, you can search, add, update, and delete the details for the adoption applications and shelters.


# Learnings and Struggles:
    During the course of building this project, we gained experience with handling and manipulating DOM elements and developing our own backend server. We struggled with our page styling, specifically using CSS flexbox, which drove us all to learn more about how to use that model. In future iterations, we would also like to incorporate a feature that allows the organization to filter animals without any adoption applications into nearby adoption events.

    Known Bugs: When editing an animal or application detail, the name of the shelter (on the animal card) and the name of the animal (on the adoption card) only updated on the DOM once the page is refreshed. 

# Acknowledgments:
    We used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
